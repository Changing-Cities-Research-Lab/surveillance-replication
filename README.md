# Higher Prevalence of Surveillance Cameras in Racially Diverse Neighborhoods across 10 US Cities

This repository contains code and scripts used in the paper **"Higher Prevalence of Surveillance Cameras in Racially Diverse Neighborhoods across 10 US Cities"**. The study leverages computer vision techniques to analyze surveillance camera prevalence across various neighborhoods in 10 U.S. cities, focusing on understanding the relationship between camera prevalence and neighborhood racial diversity.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains three R scripts used to generate the figures in the paper. Below is a description of each script:

- **`descriptive-figures.R`**: Generates the descriptive statistics and visualizations, specifically Figures 1 and 5 in the paper.
- **`cs-results.R`**: Produces the results and figures highlighting the relationship between neighborhood racial composition and surveillance camera prevalence.
- **`change-results.R`**: Produces the results and figures for findings related to changes in surveillance camera prevalence.
